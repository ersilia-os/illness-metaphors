# Trachoma

## Medicine

### General description

Trachoma is a neglected tropical disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. It is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. The disease is spread through direct personal contact, shared towels and cloths, and flies that have come into contact with the eyes or nose of an infected person. Trachoma is characterized by repeated episodes of reinfection that cause scarring on the inner surface of the eyelid, turning the eyelashes inward. This leads to scratching of the cornea, pain, and eventually blindness if left untreated. Trachoma is prevalent in over 50 countries, primarily in regions with poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and crowded living conditions. It disproportionately affects marginalized populations, particularly women and children, resulting in a significant socioeconomic burden in affected communities.

### Symptoms

Trachoma, a neglected tropical disease, presents with symptoms such as eye pain, redness, discharge, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the infection can lead to scarring of the inner eyelid, which causes the eyelashes to turn inward and scratch the cornea. This condition, known as trichiasis, results in intense discomfort, light sensitivity, and ultimately irreversible blindness if not corrected through surgery. Beyond the physical effects, trachoma can impair individuals' ability to work, attend school, and participate fully in their communities, contributing to cycles of poverty and social exclusion particularly in affected regions of low socioeconomic status.

### Treatment

The treatment for trachoma typically involves a combination of antibiotic therapy, hygiene promotion, and surgery in advanced cases. Antibiotics like azithromycin or tetracycline are commonly used to clear the bacterial infection, with treatment duration ranging from a single dose to several weeks depending on the severity. Surgery may be required to correct eyelid deformities in chronic cases. Side effects of antibiotics may include gastrointestinal disturbances or allergic reactions. The success rate of treatment is high if caught early, with complications decreasing significantly. Treatment is often available through government health programs, NGOs, and community health centers in endemic regions, sometimes free of charge or at a low cost, ensuring access for affected populations.

## Biology

### Pathogen description

Trachoma is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, specifically serovars A-C. This obligate intracellular pathogen has a unique developmental cycle involving elementary bodies for transmission and reticulate bodies for replication within host cells. Transmission primarily occurs through direct or indirect contact with eye and nose discharge from infected individuals, as well as through contaminated fomites. Chlamydia trachomatis infects the conjunctiva and cornea, leading to chronic inflammation, scarring, and potentially blindness if left untreated.

### Pathogen lifecycle

Trachoma is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, which has a complex life cycle involving two distinct stages: the elementary body (EB) and the reticulate body (RB). Initially, the infectious EB form attaches to and enters host cells, where it transforms into the metabolically active RB form. The RB replicates within the host cell, forming inclusions that can disrupt cellular function. After multiple rounds of replication, the RBs can reorganize into EBs and be released to infect neighboring cells or other individuals through close contact. This infectious cycle contributes to the chronic nature of trachoma infections in communities with poor sanitation and limited access to healthcare.

### Host response

Trachoma is caused by ocular infection with the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, specifically serovars A to C. This disease affects the eyes and is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is transmitted through contact with eye discharge from affected individuals and can be exacerbated by poor hygiene and crowded living conditions. If left untreated, repeated infections can lead to scarring of the inner eyelid, which causes the eyelashes to turn inward, scratching the surface of the eye and potentially leading to blindness. Trachoma is a neglected tropical disease mostly affecting marginalized populations in developing countries, and efforts to control its spread include antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvements.

## History

### Relation to colonialism

Trachoma, a bacterial eye infection causing blindness, has a historical connection to colonialism due to the impact of European colonial powers in regions where the disease was prevalent. Colonialism facilitated the spread of trachoma through factors like poor sanitation, overcrowding, and lack of access to healthcare services in colonized territories. The colonial policies, often aimed at exploiting local resources and labor, neglected the health of the indigenous populations, leading to a higher prevalence of diseases like trachoma. First documented in ancient Egypt, trachoma significantly affected populations in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia during the colonial era when European powers such as Britain, France, and Belgium controlled vast territories. The introduction of colonial medicine sometimes brought rudimentary treatments but also often prioritized the health of colonizers over the native populations. The local responses to trachoma varied, with some communities adopting preventive measures while others faced forced treatment or neglect from colonial authorities, reflecting the complex power dynamics of colonialism on public health issues.

### Discovery

Trachoma, a bacterial infection of the eyes, has been recognized for centuries, with mentions dating back to ancient Egypt. However, it wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that significant advancements were made in understanding and addressing the disease. Scottish ophthalmologist Herbert A. Wyllie played a pivotal role in documenting the disease in Egypt in the 1880s and describing its clinical manifestations. The use of early microscopy techniques allowed researchers to identify the Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria as the causative agent in the 20th century, solidifying our understanding of the disease. The discovery of the link between poor sanitation and trachoma transmission led to crucial public health interventions, such as the promotion of facial cleanliness and access to clean water, transforming strategies for trachoma control globally and significantly reducing its prevalence.

### Recent years

Trachoma, a bacterial infection of the eye caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, remains a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, primarily affecting communities in low-resource settings with poor sanitation and limited access to healthcare. Significant progress has been made in recent years towards the global elimination of trachoma as a public health concern, with the implementation of the World Health Organization's SAFE strategy (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvements). The use of azithromycin mass drug administration has shown promise in reducing the prevalence of the disease, alongside efforts to improve sanitation and hygiene practices. Despite these advances, challenges such as sustaining long-term control efforts, reaching remote populations, and addressing social determinants of health persist. International organizations like the WHO and NGOs continue to play a crucial role in supporting affected countries in their trachoma control programs. The future outlook for trachoma elimination is optimistic, but continued investment and collaboration are essential for achieving this goal and preventing unnecessary blindness due to this ancient disease.

## Social factors

### Social stigmas

Trachoma, a disease of the eye, carries with it a burden of shame and blame in many societies. It is often seen as a result of poor hygiene and living conditions, leading to stigmatization of those affected as dirty or backward. The language used to describe trachoma is often laden with negative connotations, equating the disease with uncleanliness or ignorance. Metaphors of blindness and darkness further alienate those suffering from trachoma, reinforcing a sense of isolation and worthlessness. These societal perceptions not only impact the daily lives of individuals with trachoma but also hinder efforts to address the root causes of the disease.

### Socioeconomic factors

In understanding the social stigmas and prejudices surrounding trachoma, it is essential to recognize the deep-rooted impact of poverty and lack of access to healthcare on its prevalence and outcomes. Trachoma, a preventable eye disease, primarily affects impoverished communities with inadequate sanitation and limited access to clean water, perpetuating a cycle of infection and blindness. Historically, trachoma has been associated with poor hygiene, leading to social stigma and discrimination against affected individuals. The disease's prevalence in marginalized populations highlights the intersection of socioeconomic factors with health disparities, where poverty, education, and healthcare access directly influence the spread and impact of trachoma, shaping societal attitudes and responses towards those affected by this neglected tropical disease.

### Western view

In Western societies, trachoma has historically been perceived as a disease of poverty and poor sanitation, often associated with overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions. This perception has led to stigmatization of individuals affected by trachoma, who are sometimes viewed as unclean or lacking proper hygiene. The colonial narrative surrounding trachoma has further perpetuated these prejudices, with Western societies using the disease as a justification for the "civilizing mission" in colonized regions. Western medicine has also played a significant role in shaping the perception of trachoma, focusing on the medical aspects of the disease while often neglecting the social determinants that contribute to its spread. Despite advancements in treatment and prevention, the social stigmas and prejudices surrounding trachoma continue to persist, highlighting the complex interplay between culture, society, and health in Western views of this disease.
