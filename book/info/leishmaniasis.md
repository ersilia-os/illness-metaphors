# Leishmaniasis

## Medicine

### General description

Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus, transmitted through the bite of infected female sandflies. There are three main forms of the disease: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. Symptoms include skin ulcers, fever, anemia, and in severe cases, can be fatal if untreated. Leishmaniasis is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, with about 1 billion people at risk of infection. The disease primarily affects marginalized populations with limited access to healthcare, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and disease burden in affected regions.

### Symptoms

Leishmaniasis presents a range of symptoms, depending on the form of the disease. Common symptoms include skin sores, which can lead to severe scarring, as well as fever, weight loss, and enlarged spleen and liver. The most severe form, visceral leishmaniasis, affects internal organs and can be fatal if left untreated. These symptoms can significantly impair patients' quality of life, causing physical pain and discomfort, leading to social stigma and isolation, and impacting their ability to work and engage in daily activities. Early detection and treatment are crucial in managing the symptoms and preventing further complications.

### Treatment

The treatment for leishmaniasis typically involves the use of drugs such as miltefosine, liposomal amphotericin B, paromomycin, or pentavalent antimonials. The duration of treatment can range from a few days to several weeks, depending on the type and severity of the infection. Common side effects of these medications include gastrointestinal issues, liver toxicity, and cardiac toxicity. The success rate of treatment varies depending on the drug used and the strain of the parasite, with cure rates ranging from 60% to 95%. Availability of treatment can vary by region, with some medications being more readily accessible in certain countries. The cost of treatment can also vary significantly, with some drugs being quite expensive and potentially out of reach for some patients. Access to treatment may be limited in resource-poor settings, leading to challenges in effectively managing the disease.

## Biology

### Pathogen description

Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. These parasites are single-celled organisms with a unique life cycle involving two main stages: a motile promastigote form in the sandfly vector and an intracellular amastigote form in the mammalian host. Transmission occurs through the bite of infected female sandflies during blood feeding. Once inside the host, the parasites invade macrophages, leading to a range of clinical manifestations depending on the species of Leishmania involved.

### Pathogen lifecycle

Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania, which have a complex life cycle involving two main stages. The parasites exist as promastigotes in the gut of the sandfly vector, proliferating and developing before being transmitted to a mammalian host during a blood meal. Once inside the host, the promastigotes are phagocytized by macrophages and transform into amastigotes, multiplying within these cells and causing the clinical manifestations of the disease. The amastigotes can be taken up by another sandfly during a subsequent blood meal, completing the cycle and allowing for further transmission to other hosts.

### Host response

The human host response to Leishmania, the pathogen causing leishmaniasis, involves a complex interplay between the parasite and the host's immune system. Upon infection, the host's immune cells, such as macrophages, attempt to phagocytize the parasite. However, Leishmania has evolved various strategies to evade destruction by the immune system, such as inhibiting the activation of macrophages. This leads to a dysregulated immune response characterized by a mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine profile, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. The resulting clinical symptoms range from self-limiting cutaneous lesions to potentially fatal visceral manifestations, depending on the parasite species and host factors. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial in managing the disease and preventing severe outcomes.

## History

### Precolonial knowledge

Pre-colonial communities had a traditional understanding of leishmaniasis, a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus transmitted by sandflies. They recognized the characteristic symptoms such as skin ulcers, fever, and enlarged spleen, often attributing the disease to supernatural causes or imbalances in the body. Local healers used various herbal remedies, incantations, and rituals to treat the afflicted individuals, aiming to restore harmony and balance within the body. The impact of leishmaniasis on the local population was significant, leading to disability, disfigurement, and even death in severe cases. Cultural beliefs often intertwined with the understanding of the disease, with spiritual concepts playing a role in diagnosis and treatment. Traditional healers held a respected position in society, acting as intermediaries between the physical and spiritual worlds to combat the disease. The historical accounts of leishmaniasis can be found in ancient texts, folklore, and oral traditions, reflecting the enduring impact of the disease on pre-colonial communities.

### Relation to colonialism

Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus, has historical ties to colonialism due to the impact of European colonization on its spread and the health of affected populations. Colonial powers such as the Spanish Conquistadors and Portuguese colonizers played a significant role in the dissemination of leishmaniasis through their extensive travel, forced labor practices, and disruption of local ecosystems, which created favorable conditions for the sandfly vectors that transmit the disease. The adoption of colonial policies such as deforestation, displacement of indigenous peoples, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure further exacerbated the burden of leishmaniasis on colonized populations. Colonial medicine often prioritized the health of colonizers over that of the indigenous population, leading to unequal access to resources and treatments for the disease. Despite these challenges, local communities have developed their own coping strategies and treatments for leishmaniasis, showcasing resilience in the face of colonial health disparities.

### Discovery

Leishmaniasis was discovered in modern times when British army surgeon William Leishman identified the parasite responsible for the disease in 1903. The disease had existed for centuries in various parts of the world, with references to its symptoms found in ancient texts dating back to 2,000 BC in the Middle East. However, it was not until the early 20th century that the causative agent, Leishmania parasites, was identified through the work of Leishman and Scottish pathologist Charles Donovan. Leishmaniasis, named after William Leishman, manifests in different forms, such as cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral, and is transmitted through the bites of infected sandflies. The discovery of the parasite responsible for leishmaniasis has been crucial for understanding its transmission, treatment, and prevention, significantly impacting public health efforts worldwide.

### Recent years

Leishmaniasis remains a significant public health concern in many parts of the world, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. According to the World Health Organization, around 700,000 to 1 million new cases of leishmaniasis occur annually, with an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 deaths attributed to the disease each year. Scientific advances have focused on the development of new diagnostic tools, treatment options, and potential vaccines. Public health measures include insecticide spraying, vector control, and raising awareness among at-risk populations. Challenges in the treatment and prevention of leishmaniasis include drug resistance, limited access to healthcare in endemic areas, and the complex nature of the disease caused by different parasite species. International organizations such as the WHO and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative play a crucial role in coordinating efforts to combat leishmaniasis. The future outlook for controlling the disease relies on continued research, surveillance, and collaboration among stakeholders to reduce its global burden.

## Social factors

### Social stigmas

Leishmaniasis, a disease often associated with poverty and tropical regions, carries with it a heavy burden of social stigma. It is often viewed as a sign of uncleanliness, neglect, or lack of education, leading to discrimination against those affected. The language used to describe leishmaniasis, such as "flesh-eating parasite" or "tropical sore," perpetuates fear and misunderstanding in society. Metaphors like "the devil's disease" further demonize those suffering from it. These stigmas not only isolate individuals with leishmaniasis but also hinder efforts to raise awareness and provide proper care, perpetuating a vicious cycle of marginalization and suffering for those already enduring the physical burden of the disease.

### Socioeconomic factors

In the context of leishmaniasis, social stigmas and prejudices often exacerbate the burden of those already marginalized by poverty and lack of access to healthcare. Historically, this neglected tropical disease has disproportionately affected low-income populations in regions with limited resources for prevention and treatment. The lack of awareness and education about leishmaniasis among these communities perpetuates misconceptions, leading to discrimination and isolation of those affected. Additionally, the stigma associated with visible symptoms such as skin lesions can further marginalize individuals, hindering their ability to seek timely care and perpetuating the cycle of poverty and ill-health.

### Western view

In Western societies, leishmaniasis, often referred to as a "tropical disease," carries social stigmas and prejudices deeply rooted in colonial narratives that have historically marginalized and exoticized regions where the disease is prevalent. The Western view of leishmaniasis is often intertwined with notions of poverty, dirtiness, and lack of development, perpetuating stereotypes about the people affected by it. This narrative has been amplified by the media, which tends to portray leishmaniasis as a distant and foreign affliction, reinforcing ideas of "us" versus "them." Despite advancements in Western medicine, these entrenched biases continue to shape how leishmaniasis is perceived and treated in Western societies, highlighting the enduring impact of colonial legacies on global health discourses.
