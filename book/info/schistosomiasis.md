# Schistosomiasis

## Medicine

### General description

Schistosomiasis is a chronic parasitic disease caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma. The disease is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in poor communities without access to safe water and adequate sanitation. The parasites enter the skin through contact with contaminated water, where they develop into adults and lay eggs in the blood vessels. Symptoms include fever, cough, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Chronic infection can lead to severe complications such as liver and spleen damage, bladder cancer, and infertility. Schistosomiasis poses a significant burden on affected populations, impacting their health, productivity, and quality of life.

### Symptoms

Schistosomiasis symptoms depend on the stage of the infection. Acute symptoms include fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in the urine or stool, while chronic symptoms can lead to organ damage such as liver enlargement, bladder cancer, kidney dysfunction, and infertility. The physical impairments can be severe, causing pain and discomfort, leading to a significant decrease in quality of life. Societal effects include stigma due to visible symptoms like blood in urine, affecting mental health and social interactions. In severe cases, schistosomiasis can be fatal if left untreated.

### Treatment

The treatment for schistosomiasis typically involves the use of praziquantel, a drug recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The standard treatment involves a single dose of praziquantel, with the dosage based on the patient's weight. Common side effects may include headache, dizziness, and abdominal pain, but these are usually mild and temporary. Praziquantel has shown high efficacy in treating schistosomiasis, with cure rates ranging from 60% to 90%. The drug is considered safe, even for pregnant women and young children. Treatment is widely available in endemic areas through mass drug administration programs, typically provided free of charge or at a minimal cost to ensure access for all at-risk populations.

## Biology

### Pathogen description

Schistosomiasis is caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. These flatworms are known as blood flukes due to their characteristic shape. Schistosomes have a complex life cycle involving freshwater snails as intermediate hosts and humans as definitive hosts. The transmission to humans occurs when contaminated water containing parasite larvae penetrates the skin. Once inside the host, the adult worms reside in blood vessels, where they can cause chronic inflammation, organ damage, and a range of symptoms. Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of people in developing countries.

### Pathogen lifecycle

The life cycle of the pathogen responsible for schistosomiasis begins with the release of parasite eggs into freshwater by an infected host. These eggs hatch into larvae, which infect specific freshwater snails. Inside the snails, the larvae develop into cercariae, which are then released into the water. Cercariae penetrate the skin of humans during water contact, leading to infection. Once inside the human host, the larvae develop into adult worms that reproduce and release eggs, perpetuating the cycle. This complex life cycle involves multiple stages and hosts to complete the transmission of the Schistosoma parasite.

### Host response

The human host response to the pathogen responsible for schistosomiasis involves both innate and adaptive immune responses. Upon infection, the host mounts an inflammatory response to try to contain the parasite. Eosinophils play a crucial role in combating the infection by releasing toxic granule proteins. Chronic infection can lead to granuloma formation around the eggs deposited by the parasite, resulting in tissue damage and fibrosis. The immune response can also contribute to the development of symptoms such as fatigue, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Over time, severe cases can lead to organ damage, particularly in the liver, spleen, and intestines. The overall impact on the host's health can be significant, affecting quality of life and predisposing to secondary infections.

## History

### Precolonial knowledge

Pre-colonial communities had a deep understanding of schistosomiasis, recognizing it as a waterborne illness linked to contaminated freshwater sources. Symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in the urine were commonly associated with the disease. Traditional treatments included herbal medicines, incantations, and spiritual rituals performed by skilled healers within the community. Schistosomiasis had a significant impact on local populations, leading to chronic illness, decreased productivity, and even death in severe cases. Cultural beliefs around the disease often involved ideas of spiritual affliction or curses, reinforcing the importance of traditional healing practices. Ancient texts and folklore sometimes referenced schistosomiasis, emphasizing the long-standing presence and recognition of this parasitic infection in pre-colonial societies.

### Relation to colonialism

Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by flatworms of the genus Schistosoma, has a strong historical link to colonialism due to the way colonial powers inadvertently facilitated its spread. Colonial powers such as the British in Africa and the French in North Africa and the Middle East introduced infrastructure projects like dams, irrigation systems, and waterways for transportation, which created ideal habitats for the freshwater snails that act as intermediate hosts for the parasites that cause schistosomiasis. Additionally, colonial policies often led to overcrowded living conditions, poor sanitation, and limited access to clean water, all of which are conducive to the transmission of the disease. The first historical accounts of schistosomiasis date back to ancient Egypt, with evidence of infections found in mummies. In more recent history, colonial medicine often focused on treating European colonizers rather than addressing the health needs of the local population, exacerbating the impact of the disease on indigenous communities. The response of the colonized populations varied, with some resisting colonial medical interventions due to distrust or cultural beliefs. Overall, the colonial legacy of schistosomiasis underscores the complex interplay between health, power, and historical context in shaping disease transmission and control strategies in colonial settings.

### Discovery

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by flatworms of the genus Schistosoma. The discovery of schistosomiasis dates back to the 1850s when Theodor Bilharz, a German pathologist working in Egypt, identified the parasites in the blood vessels of individuals suffering from the disease. Bilharz's groundbreaking work laid the foundation for understanding the transmission and pathology of schistosomiasis. The disease's prevalence in areas with poor sanitation and close contact with contaminated water was noted, providing insights into its mode of transmission. The impact of Bilharz's discovery on public health was significant, leading to improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies for schistosomiasis. Today, schistosomiasis remains a major public health issue in tropical and subtropical regions, affecting millions of people worldwide. The discovery of schistosomiasis by Theodor Bilharz revolutionized our understanding of this debilitating disease and paved the way for ongoing efforts to control its spread and impact on global health.

### Recent years

Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms of the Schistosoma genus, remains a significant public health issue in many parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of cases are concentrated. The disease is endemic in 78 countries, with an estimated 200 million people requiring treatment each year. Scientific advances have led to better understanding of the disease's transmission and pathology, as well as the development of improved diagnostic tools and more effective treatment options. Public health measures have focused on mass drug administration, snail control programs, and improved sanitation to reduce transmission. Despite these efforts, challenges such as drug resistance and the need for sustainable control strategies persist. International organizations like the World Health Organization and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation play a crucial role in supporting prevention and treatment programs. The future outlook for schistosomiasis control relies on continued research, innovative approaches, and collaborative efforts to ultimately eliminate this disease of poverty.

## Social factors

### Social stigmas

Schistosomiasis, often linked with poverty and lack of access to clean water, carries a heavy burden of social stigma and prejudice. It is viewed as a disease of the marginalized, reinforcing perceptions of uncleanliness and poor hygiene. The language used to describe it is often laden with negative connotations, depicting sufferers as dirty or uncivilized. This perpetuates discrimination and ostracization, isolating those affected from society. Metaphors such as 'parasitic invasion' further dehumanize individuals living with schistosomiasis, deepening the societal divide and impact on their quality of life.

### Socioeconomic factors

The social stigmas and prejudices surrounding schistosomiasis stem from misperceptions about its transmission and association with poverty. Historically prevalent in low-income areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water, schistosomiasis has been linked to socioeconomic status, leading to stereotypes and discrimination against affected individuals. The lack of education and awareness about the disease has also perpetuated misunderstandings and fear within communities, further marginalizing those affected. These social attitudes not only impede efforts to control the spread of schistosomiasis but also exacerbate the suffering of individuals living with the disease, highlighting the inseparable link between health outcomes and social determinants.

### Western view

In the Western world, schistosomiasis has often been portrayed as a disease of the "other", a condition associated with poverty, lack of hygiene, and underdevelopment in tropical regions. The Western view of schistosomiasis is steeped in colonial narratives, where it was depicted as a disease prevalent in colonized territories, reinforcing notions of the "civilized" West versus the "unclean" and "primitive" Other. Media representations further perpetuated stereotypes, framing those affected by schistosomiasis as needing Western intervention to combat the disease. Western medicine has played a significant role in addressing schistosomiasis through research, prevention, and treatment programs, but the deep-rooted prejudices attached to the disease continue to shape societal perceptions and perpetuate stigmas, hindering efforts to destigmatize and effectively manage schistosomiasis in Western societies.
