# Human african trypanosomiasis

## Medicine

### General description

Human African Trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma parasites transmitted to humans through the bite of infected tsetse flies. Two forms exist: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, affecting different regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Symptoms progress from the first stage characterized by fever, headaches, joint pains, and itching, to the second stage where parasites invade the central nervous system, leading to neurological symptoms such as confusion, disrupted sleep patterns, and poor coordination. If left untreated, it is almost always fatal. The disease predominantly affects rural and marginalized populations, with limited healthcare access, making early diagnosis and treatment challenging, contributing to its significant burden in endemic areas.

### Symptoms

Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, presents in two stages. In the initial or hemolymphatic stage, symptoms include fever, headaches, joint pains, and itching. As the disease progresses to the second or meningoencephalitic stage, patients may experience neurological symptoms such as confusion, poor coordination, and disturbances of sleep cycle. These symptoms can impair patients' ability to perform daily activities, affect their cognitive function, and lead to social stigmatization due to neurological manifestations. If left untreated, the disease is almost always fatal.

### Treatment

The treatment for human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, involves the use of drugs to kill the parasite. The drugs commonly used include pentamidine and suramin for the first stage of the disease, and eflornithine and melarsoprol for the second stage. The duration of treatment can range from a few days to several weeks, depending on the stage of the disease and the severity of the infection. Side effects of these medications may include nausea, vomiting, and liver toxicity. The success rate of treatment is high if the disease is diagnosed early and appropriate drugs are administered. Access to treatment can be a challenge in some regions due to factors such as cost, availability of healthcare facilities, and awareness about the disease. However, efforts are being made to improve access to these life-saving medications for those affected by human African trypanosomiasis.

## Biology

### Pathogen description

Human African Trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This unicellular pathogen is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected tsetse flies. Once inside the host, Trypanosoma brucei can evade the immune system by changing its surface proteins, allowing it to survive in the blood and lymphatic system. The parasite has a complex life cycle involving stages in the fly vector and mammalian host, leading to systemic infection and potential invasion of the central nervous system if left untreated.

### Pathogen lifecycle

The life cycle of the pathogen responsible for human African trypanosomiasis, Trypanosoma brucei, involves several stages. In the tsetse fly vector, the parasite undergoes development and multiplication in the midgut before migrating to the salivary glands. When the infected fly takes a blood meal, metacyclic trypomastigotes are injected into the host's bloodstream, where they rapidly differentiate into bloodstream trypomastigotes. These trypomastigotes multiply by binary fission, and some develop into long slender forms that can evade the host's immune system by antigenic variation. The parasite can also cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurological symptoms in the late stage of the disease.

### Host response

Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, triggers an orchestrated immune response in the human host. Upon infection with Trypanosoma parasites, the host's innate immune system is activated, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Subsequently, the adaptive immune response kicks in, involving the activation of T cells, B cells, and the production of specific antibodies against the parasite. However, the trypanosomes have developed mechanisms to evade the host's immune system, leading to chronic infection. This continuous immune activation results in systemic inflammation, which can lead to severe neurological symptoms and ultimately, if untreated, death.

## History

### Precolonial knowledge

According to historical accounts and oral traditions, pre-colonial communities in Africa had an intricate understanding of human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. The disease was recognized by its debilitating symptoms, including fever, headaches, joint pains, and eventually, disruption of the sleep-wake cycle leading to a comatose state in its advanced stages. Traditional healers played a crucial role in diagnosing and treating the illness, using a combination of herbal remedies, rituals, and spiritual interventions. Cultural beliefs attributed the cause of the disease to spiritual forces or malevolent entities, and healing often involved not only physical but also spiritual and emotional aspects to restore balance and harmony within the individual and the community. Human African trypanosomiasis had a significant impact on local populations, causing suffering, death, and social disruption, with communities developing specific practices to prevent and manage the disease to protect their well-being and way of life.

### Relation to colonialism

Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, provides a stark example of the relationship between colonialism and disease. Colonialism facilitated the spread of the disease through forced labor, displacement of populations, and poor living conditions. The impact of colonial policies on the health of the population was profound, as inadequate healthcare and living conditions exacerbated the spread of the disease. Historical accounts trace the first cases of sleeping sickness to the colonial era in Africa, with colonial powers such as Belgium and France being heavily involved. Colonial medicine often focused on the health of colonizers rather than the local population, further perpetuating the vulnerability of indigenous communities. The response of the local population to the disease varied, with some resisting colonial interventions due to mistrust and others seeking treatment. Overall, the history of human African trypanosomiasis underscores the complex and often detrimental effects of colonialism on public health in colonized regions.

### Discovery

Human African Trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, was first discovered in the 14th century. The modern discovery of the disease can be attributed to Scottish explorer David Livingstone, who in the mid-19th century noticed the devastating effects of the illness while exploring Africa. In 1901, scientists Arthur Lewis and David Bruce identified the parasite responsible for the disease, Trypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted by the tsetse fly. Their groundbreaking work established the link between the parasite and the disease, leading to the development of diagnostic tests and treatment methods. The impact of this discovery on public health was significant as it led to improved surveillance, control measures, and ultimately saved countless lives in Africa. The naming of the disease reflects its two stages: the early stage characterized by fever, headaches, and joint pains, and the later stage involving neurological symptoms leading to disrupted sleep patterns that gave rise to the term sleeping sickness.

### Recent years

Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease that affects some of the world's poorest populations in sub-Saharan Africa. With approximately 70 million people at risk of the disease, it is a significant public health concern in the region. However, recent years have seen some positive developments in the fight against the disease, with increased awareness, improved access to healthcare services, and better diagnostic tools contributing to a reduction in the number of reported cases. Scientific advances in drug development have led to the introduction of new treatment options that are more effective and less toxic than traditional therapies. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in effectively reaching remote and rural communities with healthcare services, as well as in detecting asymptomatic carriers of the parasite. International organizations such as the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization play a crucial role in coordinating efforts to control and eliminate the disease. The future outlook for human African trypanosomiasis hinges on continued investment in research, improved surveillance systems, and strengthened healthcare infrastructure in endemic regions.

## Social factors

### Social stigmas

Human African Trypanosomiasis, commonly known as sleeping sickness, carries with it a heavy burden of social stigma and prejudice. Viewed historically as a disease of poverty and neglect, those afflicted are often marginalized, labeled as dirty or uncivilized. The language used to describe the illness is laden with metaphors of invasion and corruption, portraying sufferers as victims of an insidious force. These misconceptions not only perpetuate fear and discrimination but also hinder efforts to provide proper care and support for those affected by this devastating disease, further isolating them from society and perpetuating the cycle of ignorance and suffering.

### Socioeconomic factors

Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, carries with it a heavy burden of social stigmas and prejudices that have deep roots in historical contexts of colonialism and poverty. The disease primarily affects populations in sub-Saharan Africa, where issues such as limited access to healthcare, poverty, and lack of education contribute to its spread and impact. HAT is often associated with rural areas where healthcare infrastructure is inadequate, and the population lacks resources for preventive measures. Moreover, the stigma surrounding HAT is fueled by misconceptions and fear, leading to discrimination against individuals affected by the disease. The historical neglect and marginalization of communities affected by HAT have perpetuated the cycle of poverty and poor health outcomes, further widening the gap between social groups in terms of disease prevalence and outcomes.

### Western view

In Western societies, human African trypanosomiasis, commonly known as African sleeping sickness, has historically been perceived through a colonial lens, intertwined with notions of exoticism and primitiveness. The disease has often been sensationalized in the media, perpetuating stereotypes of Africa as a hub of mysterious and dangerous illnesses. Western medicine has framed the disease as a symbol of the "other," reinforcing a narrative of a stark divide between the developed West and the underdeveloped African continent. The impact of colonized practices in shaping the Western view of human African trypanosomiasis has led to stigmatization and prejudice towards those affected, further marginalizing communities already grappling with limited resources and healthcare access.
